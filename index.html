    <H1>Personal Scripts:</H1>
    <p>On this page, there are some small test scripts. Nothing of real importance or actual use will be placed here. Instead, there will be some basic mini-projects that are meant for fun and learning some specific language</p>
    <p>Finished projects are denoted in <span class="Completed">green </span>, projects in progress are denoted in <span class="InProgress"> yellow</span> and future projects will be in <span class="future"> red </span>. Clicking on 
    <span class="Completed"> completed projects</span> will give the script.</p> 
    <ol>
    <li><a href="script1.html" class="Completed"> Drawing on a canvas, accepting user input </a> </li>
    <li> <span class="future"> Interactive globe</span></li>
    <li> <span class="future"> Project on text mining</span></li>
    <li> <span class="future"> ... many more! </span></li>
